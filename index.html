In addition to five general diatom shapes, it also includes formulae for cylinders, spheres, and prolate spheroids.  <P><B>Please Note</B>:<BR>Even though we now live in the age of enlightenement with long file namesand fat FATs, remember that BIOVOL was written in the days of yorewhen GUI was what happened to chocolate bars left out in the sun and whenthe the Law of 8.3 ruled the naming of files and directories and thounever usethed a space in the naming of said file/directory.<P>So..... if you should get a "file not found" error, just remember that those who forget thepast (or are too young to have been there in the first place) are condemned to relive it.<P> .... oh yeah, speaking of days of yore...<BR><B>Y2K Compliance</B><BR>If someone has run the program since 01/01/00, let me know what happened. There isno date-based mathematics in the program and the only time that a date function is invoke is when printing output to a file/printer. So, there shouldn't be a problem. But then again, that's whatthe Maine Dept. of Motor Vehicles said back in November, before their computer started issuingHorseless Carriage Titles for new cars. <HR size=3><FONT size=5>The BIOVOL program:<FONT><UL><LI><A href="READ_ME"><IMG ALIGN=absbottom BORDER=0 SRC="internal-gopher-text"> READ_ME</A><BR>Check here for the latest information and/or modifications to BIOVOL. <P><LI><A HREF="bvintro.html"><IMG ALIGN=absbottom BORDER=0 SRC="internal-gopher-text"> Online Manual</A>.<P><LI><A href="bvolpak21.exe"><IMG ALIGN=absbottom BORDER=0 SRC="internal-gopher-binary">BIOVOL (v2.1) package</A><BR>This is a compressed, self-extracting file containing the BIOVOL program, documentation and a demonstration data file.<P><B>A bug was discovered in BIOVOL v2.0; the results for prolate spheroid biovolume are incorrect.
