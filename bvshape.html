<HTML><TITLE>BIOVOL Manual - Shapes</TITLE><BODY><H3><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="frbtngrn.gif">The shapes</H3><HR SIZE=3>        The <I>raison d'etre</I> for BIOVOL are the first five shapes:<P><B>GOMPHONEMOID</B>  (shape code = 1)<P>This shape is named after the genus <I>Gomphonema</I>.  The gomphonemoid isrepresented by a wedge from a toroid formed by rotating an "asymmetricellipse"  about  its base.  The asymmetry is modelled through the use of twohalf ellipses. The gomphonemoid is shown in Fig. 1b.  Four measurements arerequired for this shape; the lengths of both major half-axes ( a' and a"), theminor half-axis (b)  and the height (h). Data format for batch processing  is:<PRE>	TaxaName , ShapeCode ,  a' , a" , b , h   < return ></PRE><P><B>NAVICULOID</B>  (shape code = 2)<P>Named for the genus <I>Navicula</I> , this is an elliptic cylinder. This shape is used for any taxa in which the valve faces are more or less elliptic and parrallel to one another. The naviculoid  is shown in Fig. 1a;  the three measurements required are the height (h) and the lengths of the major and minor semi-axes (a and b, resp.).  Data format for batch processing is:<PRE>	TaxaName,  ShapeCode , a ,  , b , h   < return ></PRE><P><CENTER><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="bvfig1.gif"></IMG></CENTER><P><B>CYMBELLOID</B>   (shape code = 3)<P>Named after the genus <I>Cymbella</I> ,  the cymbelloid is a section from a prolatespheroid (think of a lemon wedge).  The cymbelloid is shown in Fig. 2a; thethree measurements required are height (h), and the lengths of the major and minor semi-axes (a  and  b, resp.).  Data format for batch processing is:<PRE>	TaxaName ,  ShapeCode , a , , b , h  < return ></PRE><P><B>AMPHOROID</B>    (shape code = 4)The amphoroid shape, named after the genus <I>Amphora</I> , is half of a prolate spheroid bisected along the major axis.  The amphoroid is shown in Fig. 2b.;the two measurements required  are the lengths of the major and minor semi-axes (a  and  b, resp.).  Data format for batch processing  is:<PRE>	TaxaName ,  ShapeCode , a, , b ,    < return ></PRE><P><B>EUNOTIOID</B>    (shape code = 5)<P>The eunotioid, named after the genus <I>Eunotia</I> , is half of a elliptic prismbisected along the the major axis.  The eunotioid is shown in Fig. 2c, ; thethree measurements required are height (h), and the lengths of the major and minor semi-axes (a  and  b, resp.).  Data format for batch processing  is:<PRE>	TaxaName ,  ShapeCode , a ,  , b , h  < return ></PRE><P><CENTER><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="bvfig2.gif"></IMG></CENTER><HR>Three additional shapes have been included in BIOVOL :<P><B>CYLINDER</B>  (shape code = 6)<P>Two measurements are required for the cylinder (Fig. 3a) , height (h) andradius (r) . Data format for batch processing is:<PRE>	TaxaName,  ShapeCode , r ,  ,  , h  < return ></PRE><P><B>SPHERE</B>  (shape code = 7)<P>One measurement is required for the sphere (Fig. 3b), radius (r).
