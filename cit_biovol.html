<HTML> <HEAD> <TITLE>BIOVOL - Citation Information</TITLE><BODY>A number of authors have reported that editors have still been giving them problemsabout citing BIOVOL in their research publications, because BIOVOL is only beingdistributed via the Web. Even with their recent revision, CBE's style manual is stillhopelessly out-of-date on this matter and given the economics of publishing it will, no doubt, be several more years before we can expect to see guidelines for citingWeb-based information included in their manual. However, there are a number of wellestablished style guides that include information on the format for the citation ofcomputer software and online resources these include; Turabian (6th ed), the ModernLanguages Association and American Psychological Association style guides and theInternational Standards Organization (ISO 690-2). Additionally, information can befound online at the following sites:<P><UL symbol=none>   <A href=http://www.eeicom.com/eye/utw/96aug.html>The Editorial Eye - Citing     Internet Resources</A><BR>   <A href=http://www.wilpaterson.edu/wpcpages/library/citing.htm> William     Paterson University - Guide for Citing Electronic Information</A><BR>   <A href=http://www.uvm.edu/~ncrane/estyles/>Bibliographic Formats for     Citing Electronic Information</A><BR>   <A href=http://www.nlc-bnc.ca./ifla/I/training/citation/citing.htm> National     Library of Canada - Citation Guides for Electronic Documents </A></UL><P>Using the Chicago/Turabian format for computer software and web citations, BIOVOLshould be cited similar to (depending upon where you down loaded the file from):<P><UL><B>	Kirschtel, D.B. 1996.

Today, however, refusing to allow the citation of online resources is just plain ignorant. The use of online information and resources is an integral partof doing science as we stand on the threshhold of the 21st Century. My short and snotty suggestion to you is to stop being a dinosaur. If it sounds like I'm pissed, ... I am. I'm tired of being blown-off by editors, seeing my intellectual endeavors being condensed to the anonymous phrase "biovolumes were calculated using standard geometric shapes" merely because you steadfastly cling to some antiquated notion of what a legitimate reference is and refuse to allow the citation of online resources. At the least, you are interfering with the proper distribution of scientific information. At worst, for all intents and purposes, you are forcing responsible authors to commit plagiarism by barring them from properly citing significant extrinsic information.MLA, APA as well as several other professional organizations have established guidelines for the citation of online information.  Turabian covers this in the sixth edition of "A Manual for Writers of Term Papers...".  The International Standards Organization has developed standards for bibliographic citation of online resources (ISO 690-2). Even "Science" is accepting web references (just go to http://www.sciencemag.org/search.shtml and search for "http://" in "Words Anywhere inArticle") If this still isn't sufficient, you might look to the following "citations" for enlightenment:	http://www.eeicom.com/eye/utw/96aug.html	http://www.wilpaterson.edu/wpcpages/library/citing.htm 	http://www.uvm.edu/~ncrane/estyles/ 	http://www.nlc-bnc.ca./ifla/I/training/citation/citing.htmIf your concern is that that the web is ephemeral, who's to say that any other software source is going to be around tomorrow, let alone five years from now. That's the nature of the information age. Anyone seen Ashton-Tate, Digital Research, Central Point or WordPerfect Corp. lately? When was the last time you were able to find a copy VisiCalc or WordStar? Ned Ludd was never able to seize the clockworks of time, are you likewise trying to engage in such a futile effort?[signed]David KirschtelDeveloper and Distributor of BIOVOL.  College of Natural Sciences112 North Kedzie LabMichigan State UniversityEast Lansing, MI USA 48824email: kirschte@msu.edutel: 507.432.0898this document available at: http://www.uvm.edu/~dkirscht/cit_biovol.html orhttp://www.msu.edu/~kirschte/cit_biovol.html</PRE></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
