<HTML><TITLE>BIOVOL Manual - Running Biovol</TITLE><BODY><H3><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="frbtngrn.gif">Running the Program</H3><HR SIZE=3><B>The Main Menu</B><P>There are four options available in the main menu:<DL><DT><B>Batch</B><DD> in batch mode an existing data file is processed, with 		output being  sent to either an output file, to a printer or the 		screen only.  For large data sets this is most likely the most 	efficientmethod, data files are compiled prior to running the program and thenprocessed at one time.<P><DT><B>Interactive</B><DD>in interactive mode, the user can directly input cell measurements.  Output can be directed to either to an output file, to aprinter or the screen only.  The user is prompted for all the requisite data toperform the calculations. A menu of shape codes is also provided.<P><DT><B>Shell</B><DD>this allows the user to temporarily return to the operating 		system.  The user then has the ability to use DOS commands (such as 	DIR to locate files) or run other programs (i.e. modify a data file using a 	text editor).<P><DT><B>Exit</B> <DD>this terminates the program and returns control to the operating system.</DL><HR SIZE=1><H3>Screen Layout</H3>Once either of the operating modes has been chosen (batch orinteractive) the work area screen  (Fig 4.) is displayed. For both operatingmodes the screen layout is similar.  The top "window" is used to displayoutput.  Results are displayed on the screen  for both file and printer output inaddition to screen only operation.  The middle region of the screen ( the upperboxed "window" is reserved for user input. For batch operation prompts fordata file name and output  mode are displayed here. In interactive modeprompts for cell information ( taxa name, shape code,  measurement etc.) aredisplayed here. Additionally a menu of shape codes is displayed on the rightside.  The lower most  "window" is reserved for the display of error messages,identifying the nature of the problem as well as instructions on how to recoverfrom the error.  The bottom line of the display is the message  <TT>QUIT  -  &lt F5 &gt &lt Return &gt </TT>, by pressing the F5 key and then "return "  the user leaves the work area and returns to the main menu.<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bvfig4.gif"></CENTER><HR SIZE=1><H3>Batch operation</H3><B>The data file</B><P>BIOVOL requires that the data file be a comma delimited ASCII file.  Ifyou  use either a word processor or spreadsheet to compile the data file besure to save the file in an ASCII format before running BIOVOL.  Each lineneeds to end with a carriage return/line feed <TT> &lt CR/LF &gt </TT> character and the last line of the file must end with an end-of file <TT> &lt EOF &gt </TT> character.<P>Only the first eight characters of the taxa name will be retained in theoutput, so make sure that the most critical  ID information is present in thisspace.<P><B>The output file</B><P>	The output file will be saved at the same location as the data file (drive/directory).  The filename will be the same as the data file with the file type as <TT>.LST</TT> (i. e., the data file <TT>C:\BVDEMO.DAT</TT> will produce a file named <TT>C:\BVDEMO.LST</TT>).  Columns are labelled on the first line of the file, in the same sequence as they appear on the screen (Taxa , biovolume, surface area and surface-to-volume ratio)<HR SIZE=1><H3>Interactive operation</H3><B>Data input</B><P>Prompts for the required information will be displayed in the input area.Only the first eight characters of the taxa name will be retained in the output,so make sure that the most critical  ID information is present in this space.<P><B>The output file</B><P>When prompted for an output file name, provide only <TT> &lt drive &gt:\&lt directory....&gt\&lt filename &gt </TT>, <B>DO NOT</B> include filetype, the output filetype is set by BIOVOL as <TT>.LST</TT>. (i. e. a "legal" response is <TT> C:\BVDEMO <rtn> </TT>, this will result in an output file named <TT> C:\BVDEMO.LST </TT>).<HR><CENTER><A HREF="biovol.html"><IMG ALT="BIOVOL Homepage" SRC="bvhombtn.gif"></A><A HREF="bvintro.html"><IMG ALT="Introduction" SRC="bvintbtn.gif"></A><A HREF="bvterm.html"><IMG ALT="Terms" SRC="bvtrmbtn.gif"></A><A HREF="bvshape.html"><IMG ALT="Shapes" SRC="bvshpbtn.gif"></A><A HREF="bvlegal.html"><IMG ALT="Legal Stuff" SRC="bvlglbtn.gif"></A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
