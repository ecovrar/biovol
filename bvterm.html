For the gomphonemoid this distance is measured from thebroadest area of the valve (not nesessarily the central area) to the apex (a')and to the basis (a") (Fig 1b), these two measurements being needed due tothe asymmetry of the frustule.<P><DT><B>minor semi-axis</B> (b)<DL>for most taxa this is the diatance from the	central area to the lateral margin of the cell (Fig 1a). Again, for thegomphonemoid this is measured at the broadest area of the valve (Fig. 1b).Also for the cymbelloid and eunotioid this is the full width of the frustule (Figs2a and c).</DL><HR SIZE=3><CENTER><A HREF="biovol.html"><IMG ALT="BIOVOL Homepage" SRC="bvhombtn.gif"></A><A HREF="bvintro.html"><IMG ALT="Introduction" SRC="bvintbtn.gif"></A><A HREF="bvshape.html"><IMG ALT="Shapes" SRC="bvshpbtn.gif"></A><A HREF="bvrun.html"><IMG ALT="Running BIOVOL" SRC="bvrunbtn.gif"></A><A HREF="bvlegal.html"><IMG ALT="Legal Stuff" SRC="bvlglbtn.gif"></A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
