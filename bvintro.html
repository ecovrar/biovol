However there was a trade-off. The improvement in representing the shapes of diatoms resulted in formulae that effectively prevented doing calculations by hand (or hand-held calculator, for that matter). Out of this came BIOVOL, write the code once and let the computer deal with monotonous calculations.<P>  The original BIOVOL program (ver. 1.0) was written for my own use (although one copy was distributed) and therefore was far from user friendly. Hopefully most of this has been dealt with (however be prepared for some kludgy spots).<P>  In addition to calculating cell biovolume and surface area, surface to volume ratio is also calculated.<HR SIZE=3><CENTER><A HREF="biovol.html"><IMG ALT="BIOVOL Homepage" SRC="bvhombtn.gif"></A><A HREF="bvterm.html"><IMG ALT="Terms" SRC="bvtrmbtn.gif"></A><A HREF="bvshape.html"><IMG ALT="Shapes" SRC="bvshpbtn.gif"></A><A HREF="bvrun.html"><IMG ALT="Running BIOVOL" SRC="bvrunbtn.gif"></A><A HREF="bvlegal.html"><IMG ALT="Legal Stuff" SRC="bvlglbtn.gif"></A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
